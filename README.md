# TDT4305---Big-Data---Part-One
This repository is a part of an assignment in the course TDT4305 - Big Data Architectures, and consists of several tasks regarding the extraction and manipulation of data in large data-sets. 


The code is split into three distinct .py files, one for each task. To run the subtasks from the different tasks, the python file can be run, with the path to the directory containing the datasets as an argument. There is no need to specify the datasets themselves, only the directory containing the datasets. 

Example: python task2.py /user/example/data
